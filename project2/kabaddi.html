    <h2>Kabaddi</h2><br>
    <p>Kabaddi is a contact team sport where players from two teams take turns sending a "raider" into the opponent’s half to tag defenders and return without being tackled, all in a single breath. It is popular in South Asia, especially India, and is played in formats like **circle style** and **indoor style**.
